# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Tool

This project focuses on building a web-based application to predict diabetes using machine learning models. After evaluating multiple algorithms, the **Decision Tree Classifier** was selected as the best-performing model and deployed using **Streamlit**.

🔗 **Live App**: [Diabetes Prediction Tool](https://diabetes-prediction-72yqsvfdmtxa6xar2fcj5d.streamlit.app/)

## 📌 Objective

To develop a reliable machine learning model for predicting diabetes based on clinical and demographic data, and to deploy the best model in a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.

---

## 🧬 Features Used

The model was trained on the following features:

- **BMI** (Body Mass Index)  
- **Systolic Blood Pressure**  
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**  
- **Age**  
- **Glucose Level**  
- **Number of Pregnancies**  
- **Insulin**  
- **Skin Thickness**
